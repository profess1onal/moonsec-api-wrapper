# MoonSec API Wrapper

Install packages via `npm i --save`.

## !! THIS PROBABLY DOESN'T WORK !!

MoonSec v3 is now paid, so I don't have an API key to it now. If you do have an API key for it, feel free to give a pull request to this dead repo and update it a bit, not that I expect anyone to do that.

Below this point probably will never be used again.
